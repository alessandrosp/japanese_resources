## JPLT

### Vocabulary

Sources: [Kanshudo](https://www.kanshudo.com/collections/wikipedia_jlpt).

List of words associated with the various JPLT levels. Note that there isn't an official list of words. These lists are created by collating various unofficial lists and they can be expected to be more or less correct in the sense that these words have a high probability to be used in the tests.

That said, there is not guarantee that words that are not in these lists won't appear on any of the tests (see *[I just want to remind everyone there is no Official JLPT N1 Vocab list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/5gnt58/i_just_want_to_remind_everyone_there_is_no/)*).

The various words presented as part of WaniKani. They are grouped based on the levels at which they appear.

Below, you can find a table showing the coverage of JLPT N-levels by WaniKani levels. Note that one of the reasons why the coverage appears to be so low is because WaniKani doesn't cover words that are made entirely of kana (e.g. きれい).
